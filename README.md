# Mazen Alziq: Simple Content-Based Recommendation System


## Dataset

Data was found on *Kaggle*. To download it, you can go onto [Kaggle.com/datasets](Kaggle.com/datasets), type in "IMDB Movies Dataset", and simply click download in the top right corner.

## Setup 

The script should preferably be ran in an IDE or on a Jupyter server, not on the command line. Thus, you will be prompted to install any uninstalled from within the IDE itself, no need for pip install. The dataset must be in the same working directory as the .ipynb file. 

Additionally, you must update the file path in the code where it says `file_path = '/Users/mazenalziq/PycharmProject/AI/Lumaa_AI/imdb_top_500.csv'`, to your own personal file path of the dataset.

## Running

The Jupyter notebook can be ran in any IDE that supports Jupyter, such as PyCharm or VScode. It can also be ran on a jupyter notebooks web server, or from the command line after downloading the .ipynb file. Simply hit "Run All Cells", and the user will be prompted to enter a prompt, and then an output will be displayed.
